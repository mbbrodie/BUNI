Generative models, particularly GANs, remain difficult to quantitatively evaluate.
As with traditional metrics, GAN evaluation methods must be efficient and reproducible. 
Unlike other measures, however, an effective GAN metric must also consider mode coverage, output diversity, output quality, and penalize exact memorization of the training data.
