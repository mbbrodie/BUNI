\subsection{Adversarial Divergence}
\label{sub:adversarial_divergence}

Adversarial Divergence uses human-generated labels to group both the real and generated images.
Then, the distance metric between the real and generated images in each group can be calculated easily. \cite{papernot2016distillation}

This method, however, requires human-generated labels, which can be expensive and therefore less scalable.
