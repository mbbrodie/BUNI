\subsection{Classifier Two Sample Test}
\label{sub:classifier_two_sample_test}

Classifier Two Sample tests (C2ST) \cite{borji2018pros} are used to determine if two samples are taken from the same distribution, and according to \cite{2016arXiv161006545L} they have potential in the evaluation of GANs.
A C2ST is performed by creating a binary classifier and training it to discriminate between samples collected from two distributions.
This classifier is then tested on novel samples from these distributions.
If it is unable to accurately classify the samples according to their distribution, then the two distributions are declared to be equal.
A more detailed explanation of the process is found in \cite{borji2018pros} and \cite{2016arXiv161006545L}.
INPUT EQUATION HERE IF WE WANT IT
According to \cite{2016arXiv161006545L}, C2STs are useful because they are easily implemented, can learn data representations dynamically, and are flexible and varied in their implementations.
One of the difficulties of working with C2STs are that they are by nature binary and therefore have difficulty discriminating more than two classes.
Another problem is that C2STs are not well equipped to judge a GAN based on the diversity of its outputs, meaning it can grade very well a network that generates the same image for each input.
